# Visual Metronome Extended

This is an extension/modification that uses some code found in the base 
[Visual Metronome plugin](https://github.com/vincent0955/Visual-metronome) and makes
some updates that fit my personal use case.

A simple overlay that displays a box on your screen that changes color every game tick. 

Used for the same purposes as the regular metronome, timing based activities such as PvM or 3-tick fishing. 
Helpful for if you don't have sound, are listening to music, or just prefer a visual cue.

# Usage

Alt+right click on the overlay to reset to default size
